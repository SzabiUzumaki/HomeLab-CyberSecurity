# HomeLab-CyberSecurity
My journey in the field of cybersecurity. Remain safe from attacks at all times.

My First Homelab: A Journey into Practical Cybersecurity for SOC Analysis

How do you do? Welcome to my GitHub repository, which is essentially the heart and soul of my safe homelab project. This isn't just a collection of bits and bobs – it's my dedicated laboratory, my training ground, and the hub for developing my cybersecurity skills. I'm fully committed to building a solid, practical foundation that will undoubtedly improve my career into a Security Operations Centre (SOC) Analyst role.

About This Endeavour
I started this home lab trip in order to have practical, hands-on experience with cybersecurity principles and tools, which are crucial in today's digital environment. It's not enough to soak up theory. I also need to get my hands dirty, implement, test, and really understand the ins and outs of how everything works. This is how I directly study for certifications, learn more about

The advice I've received about this being the "best way to gain practical, real-world experience" really resonated with me. I'm keen to embrace the philosophy of "breaking things, fixing them, and understanding the underlying mechanisms" because that's where the real learning happens, without the constant dread of impacting production systems!

Key Technologies and Concepts I'll Be Exploring:
Virtualisation: (e.g., Proxmox VE, VMware ESXi, VirtualBox, Hyper-V) – the foundational bedrock upon which everything else will sit.
Networking: VLANs, firewall rules, routing – figuring out how to achieve robust segmentation and secure communication.
Operating Systems: Linux (Kali, Ubuntu Server), Windows (Server, 10/11) – the crucial environments for both offensive and defensive operations.
Security Tools: SIEM, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanners, offensive tools – the practical application of cutting-edge tech.
Automation & Scripting: (e.g., Ansible, Python, PowerShell) – streamlining processes and making my lab more efficient and scalable.
Containerisation: (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) – if and when I decide to dip my toe into this particular pond.
