Phase 3, Step 5: Simplified E-mail Server Setup
Setting up a full-fledged, internet-facing email server with all security features is notoriously complex. For a homelab focused on SOC analysis, we just need something that generates mail logs and allows for basic internal communication within your domain. We'll set up a simple SMTP (Postfix) and IMAP (Dovecot) server on your existing Ubuntu_Server_Base VM.

This setup will allow users within your homelab.local domain to send emails to each other, generating logs that a SOC analyst would typically review for things like phishing attempts, spam, or unusual mail flow.

A. Install Postfix (Mail Transfer Agent - MTA)
Postfix handles sending and receiving email.

Log in to your Ubuntu_Server_Base VM.

Update your system:

Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
Install Postfix:

Bash

sudo apt install postfix -y
During installation, you'll see a blue configuration screen:
General type of mail configuration: Choose Internet Site.
System mail name: Enter your domain name, e.g., homelab.local. This tells Postfix what domain it's responsible for.
Root and postmaster mail recipient: Leave blank or use your Ubuntu username.
Other destinations for mail accepted by this host: homelab.local, localhost.localdomain, localhost (add your domain name if not already there).
Force synchronous updates on mail queue: No
Local networks: 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128 192.168.1.0/24 (Make sure 192.168.1.0/24 is included so your internal network can relay mail).
Mailbox size limit (bytes): 0 (for no limit).
Local policy for recipients: all
Internet protocols to use: all
Verify Postfix status:

Bash

sudo systemctl status postfix
It should show active (running).

B. Install Dovecot (IMAP/POP3 Server)
Dovecot allows users to retrieve their email from the server using clients like Outlook or Thunderbird.

Install Dovecot:
Bash

sudo apt install dovecot-imapd dovecot-pop3d -y
Verify Dovecot status:
Bash

sudo systemctl status dovecot
It should show active (running).
C. Create Mail Users (Linux System Users)
For this simple setup, Postfix and Dovecot rely on standard Linux system users to have mailboxes. You'll create a few users on your Ubuntu_Server_Base VM that can send and receive mail.

Create a test user:
Bash

sudo adduser testuser1
sudo adduser testuser2
Follow the prompts to set passwords and user info for testuser1 and testuser2.
D. Configure Mail Clients (on your Win11_Client VM)
To test the mail server, you'll need a mail client on your domain-joined Windows 11 VM. We can use Thunderbird.

Log in to your Win11_Client VM.

Download and Install Thunderbird:

Open your web browser (Edge/Chrome).
Go to https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/ and download the installer.
Run the installer and install Thunderbird.
Configure Thunderbird for testuser1@homelab.local:

Launch Thunderbird.
When prompted, choose "Skip integration" if you just want to set up an account.
For the "Set up your existing email address" prompt:
Your name: Test User 1
Email address: testuser1@homelab.local
Password: The password you set for testuser1 on the Ubuntu server.
Click "Continue".
Thunderbird will try to auto-configure. It will likely fail. Click "Configure manually".
Manual Settings:
Incoming:
Protocol: IMAP
Server hostname: 192.168.1.x (the IP address of your Ubuntu_Server_Base VM on the Homelab_Internal network, e.g., 192.168.1.101 if you assign a static IP to it or found it via ip a)
Port: 143 (for IMAP, or 993 for IMAPS - we're not doing SSL for simplicity)
Connection security: None
Authentication method: Normal password
Outgoing:
Protocol: SMTP
Server hostname: 192.168.1.x (same IP as above)
Port: 25 (for SMTP, or 587 for submission with STARTTLS, not doing for simplicity)
Connection security: None
Authentication method: Normal password
Click "Done". If it asks about accepting an unencrypted connection, accept it.
Repeat for testuser2@homelab.local: Configure another account in Thunderbird for testuser2 following the same steps.

E. Test Internal Mail Flow
From testuser1's account in Thunderbird, compose a new email to testuser2@homelab.local.
Send the email.
Switch to testuser2's account in Thunderbird and check the inbox. You should receive the email.
Send a reply from testuser2 to testuser1.
This confirms your mail server is processing internal mail!

F. Locate Mail Server Logs
Mail logs are a rich source of information for SOC analysts, showing who is sending/receiving, from where, and any errors or spam detections.

On your Ubuntu_Server_Base VM:
Most mail logs are written to the system's general log file:
Bash

sudo less /var/log/mail.log
(Press q to quit less).
You can also often find them in syslog or auth.log depending on the activity:
Bash

sudo less /var/log/syslog
sudo less /var/log/auth.log
Look for entries from postfix/smtp, postfix/submission, dovecot, etc., that show your test emails.
