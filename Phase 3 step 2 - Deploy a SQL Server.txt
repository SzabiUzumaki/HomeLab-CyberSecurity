Phase 3, Step 2: Deploy a SQL Server
Database servers are another common target for attackers and generate distinct types of logs. We'll install a free version of SQL Server on your AD Domain Controller for simplicity, again noting that in production, you'd separate these roles.

A. Install SQL Server Express
Log in to your AD_Domain_Controller VM.

Download SQL Server Express:

Open Edge/Internet Explorer and go to: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads
Under "Express", click "Download now". This will download a small installer.
Run the Installer:

Run the downloaded SQLEXPR_ENU.exe (or similar name).
Choose the "Basic" installation type for simplicity.
Accept the license terms.
Choose the installation location (default is fine).
It will download the installation files and then proceed with the installation. This might take a while.
Complete Installation:

Once done, you'll see a screen with connection string details. Make a note of the "SQL Server name" (e.g., YOURSERVERNAME\SQLEXPRESS). You'll need this to connect.
You can click "Install SSMS" if you want the graphical management studio, but it's a large download and not strictly necessary for just getting logs initially. We'll manage from the command line or use simple tools for now.
B. Basic SQL Server Configuration & Test
Verify Service Status:

Open Services (search for services.msc).
Look for "SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)". Ensure its status is "Running".
Enable Remote Connections (Crucial for Client Access):

On your AD_Domain_Controller VM, search for and open "SQL Server Configuration Manager".
In the left pane, expand "SQL Server Network Configuration".
Click on "Protocols for SQLEXPRESS".
In the right pane, right-click "TCP/IP" and select "Properties".
Go to the "IP Addresses" tab.
Scroll down to the IPAll section.
TCP Dynamic Ports: Clear this field (make it blank).
TCP Port: Enter 1433.
Click "OK".
Go back to "Protocols for SQLEXPRESS", right-click "TCP/IP", and select "Enable".
In the left pane, click on "SQL Server Services".
Right-click "SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)" and select "Restart".
Configure Windows Firewall for SQL:

On your AD_Domain_Controller VM, search for and open "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security".
In the left pane, click on "Inbound Rules".
In the right pane, click "New Rule...".
Rule Type: Port
Protocol and Ports:
TCP
Specific local ports: 1433
Action: Allow the connection
Profile: Check Domain and Private (public is generally not needed for internal lab).
Name: SQL Server (TCP-In)
Click "Finish".
Test Connectivity from Win10_Client VM:

We need a tool to connect. The easiest is to use PowerShell.
Open PowerShell on your Win10_Client VM.
Try to connect (replace AD_Domain_Controller with its actual hostname or IP):
PowerShell

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AD_Domain_Controller -Port 1433
The output should show TcpTestSucceeded : True. This means the client can reach the SQL Server on port 1433.
C. Locate SQL Server Logs
SQL Server logs are different from Windows Event Logs or IIS logs.

On your AD_Domain_Controller VM:
Open SQL Server Configuration Manager again.
In the left pane, click on "SQL Server Services".
Right-click "SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS)" and select "Properties".
Go to the "Advanced" tab.
Look for the "Dump Directory" or "Error Log path". This is often where the main error logs are stored.
The main SQL Server error logs are typically found in a path like: C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL16.SQLEXPRESS\MSSQL\Log\ (the MSSQL16.SQLEXPRESS part might vary based on your version and instance name).
The logs are named ERRORLOG, ERRORLOG.1, etc. Open one with Notepad to see database activity, errors, and authentication attempts.
